I have gained hands-on experience in Software Engineering, IT support, project management, and Cybersecurity.I have a Bachelor's degree in Business and Information Technology. I have developed a range of impactful projects, including an e-commerce platform that strengthened my ability to build secure, scalable, and maintainable web applications using modern PHP frameworks. Full-stack applications using React, Python, and Django, and managing projects in the construction and technology sectors. Looking ahead, my ambition is to grow as a software engineer, leverage my cybersecurity knowledge, and contribute to innovative digital solutions that address real-world challenges in financial technologies, sustainable agriculture, and digital inclusion.
